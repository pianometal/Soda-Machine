    CODING CHALLENGES

    Write a program that presents the user w/ a choice of your 5 favorite beverages (Coke, Water, Sprite, ... , Whatever).
    Then allow the user to choose a beverage by entering a number 1-5.
    Output which beverage they chose.

    If the user enters a choice other than 1-5 then it will output
    "Error. choice was not valid, here is your money back."
 
    Update - My good friend @KevinWilliams68 on GitHub challenged me to refactor this as a switch statement instead of an if else ladder. I then went ahead and made a few simple functions that execute within main.
